#' PrInCE: Prediction of Interactomes from Co-Elution
#'
#' PrInCE is a computational approach to infer protein-protein interaction
#' networks from co-elution proteomics data, also called co-migration,
#' co-fractionation, or protein correlation profiling. This family of methods
#' separates interacting protein complexes on the basis of their diameter
#' or biochemical properties. Protein-protein interactions can then be
#' inferred for pairs of proteins with similar elution profiles. PrInCE
#' implements a machine-learning approach to identify protein-protein
#' interactions given a set of labelled examples, using features derived
#' exclusively from the data. This allows PrInCE to infer high-quality
#' protein interaction networks from raw proteomics data, without bias
#' towards known interactions or functionally associated proteins, making
#' PrInCE a unique resource for discovery.
#'
#' PrInCE takes as input a co-elution matrix, with detected proteins in rows and
#' fractions as columns, and a set of 'gold standard' true positives and true
#' negatives. If replicate experiments were performed, a list of co-elution
#' matrices can be provided as input. PrInCE will construct features for each
#' replicate separately and use features from all replicates as input to the
#' classifier. The 'gold standard' can be either a data frame or adjacency
#' matrix of known interactions (and non-interactions), or a list of protein
#' complexes. For computational convenience, Gaussian mixture models can be
#' pre-fit to every profile and provided separately to the \code{PrInCE}
#' function. The matrix, or matrices, can be provided to PrInCE either as
#' numeric matrices or as \code{\linkS4class{MSnSet}} objects.
#'
#' PrInCE implements three different types of classifiers to predict
#' protein-protein interaction networks, including naive Bayes (the default),
#' random forests, and support vector machines. The classifiers are trained
#' on the gold standards using a ten-fold cross-validation procedure, training
#' on 90% of the data and predicting on the remaining 10%. For protein pairs
#' that are part of the training data, the held-out split is used to assign
#' a classifier score, whereas for the remaining protein pairs, the median of
#' all ten folds is used. Furthermore, to ensure the results are not sensitive
#' to the precise classifier split used, an ensemble of multiple classifiers
#' (ten, by default) is trained, and the classifier score is subsequently
#' averaged across classifiers. PrInCE can also ensemble across a set of
#' classifiers.
#'
#' By default, PrInCE calculates six features from each pair of co-elution
#' profiles as input to the classifier, including conventional similarity
#' metrics but also several features specifically adapted to co-elution
#' proteomics. For example, one such feature is derived
#' from fitting a Gaussian mixture model to each elution profile, then
#' calculating the smallest Euclidean distance between any pair of fitted
#' Gaussians. The complete set of features includes:
#'
#' \enumerate{
#'   \item the Pearson correlation between raw co-elution profiles;
#'   \item the p-value of the Pearson correlation between raw co-elution
#'     profiles;
#'   \item the Pearson correlation between cleaned profiles, which are generated
#'     by imputing single missing values with the mean of their neighbors,
#'     replacing remaining missing values with random near-zero noise, and
#'     smoothing the profiles using a moving average filter (see
#'     \code{\link[PrInCE]{clean_profile}});
#'  \item the Euclidean distance between cleaned profiles;
#'  \item the 'co-peak' score, defined as the distance, in fractions, between
#'    the maximum values of each profile; and
#'  \item the 'co-apex' score, defined as the minimum Euclidean distance between
#'    any pair of fit Gaussians
#' }
#'
#' The output of PrInCE is a ranked data frame, containing the classifier score
#' for every possible protein pair. PrInCE also calculates the precision at
#' every point in this ranked list, using the 'gold standard' set of protein
#' complexes or binary interactions. Our recommendation is to select a
#' threshold for the precision and use this to construct an unweighted
#' protein interaction network.
#'
#' @param profiles the co-elution profile matrix, or a list of profile matrices
#'   if replicate experiments were performed. Can be a single numeric matrix,
#'   with proteins in rows and fractions in columns, or a list of matrices.
#'   Alternatively, can be provided as a single
#'   \code{\linkS4class{MSnSet}} object or a list of objects.
#' @param gold_standard a set of 'gold standard' interactions, used to train the
#'   classifier. Can be provided either as an adjacency matrix, in which
#'   both rows and columns correspond to protein IDs in the co-elution matrix
#'   or matrices, or as a list of proteins in the same complex, which will be
#'   converted to an adjacency matrix by PrInCE. Zeroes in the adjacency matrix
#'   are interpreted by PrInCE as "true negatives" when calculating precision.
#' @param gaussians optionally, provide Gaussian mixture models fit by
#'   the \code{\link[PrInCE]{build_gaussians}} function. If \code{profiles} is
#'   a numeric matrix, this should be the named list output by
#'   \code{\link[PrInCE]{build_gaussians}} for that matrix; if \code{profiles}
#'   is a list of numeric matrices, this should be a list of named lists
#' @param precision optionally, return only interactions above the given
#'   precision; by default, all interactions are returned and the user can
#'   subsequently threshold the list using the
#'   \code{\link[PrInCE]{threshold_precision}} function
#' @param verbose if \code{TRUE}, print a series of messages about the stage
#'   of the analysis
#' @param min_points filter profiles without at least this many total,

#' @param min_consecutive filter profiles without at least this many
#'   consecutive, non-missing points; passed to \code{\link{filter_profiles}}
#' @param min_pairs minimum number of overlapping fractions between any given
#'   protein pair to consider a potential interaction
#' @param impute_NA if true, impute single missing values with the average of
#'   neighboring values; passed to \code{\link{clean_profiles}}
#' @param smooth if true, smooth the chromatogram with a moving average filter;
#'   passed to \code{\link{clean_profiles}}
#' @param smooth_width width of the moving average filter, in fractions;
#'   passed to \code{\link{clean_profiles}}
#' @param max_gaussians the maximum number of Gaussians to fit; defaults to 5.
#'   Note that Gaussian mixtures with more parameters than observed (i.e.,
#'   non-zero or NA) points will not be fit. Passed to
#'   \code{\link{choose_gaussians}}
#' @param criterion the criterion to use for model selection;
#'   one of "AICc" (corrected AIC, and default), "AIC", or "BIC". Passed to
#'   \code{\link{choose_gaussians}}
#' @param max_iterations the number of times to try fitting the curve with
#'   different initial conditions; defaults to 50. Passed to
#'   \code{\link{fit_gaussians}}
#' @param min_R_squared the minimum R-squared value to accept when fitting the
#'   curve with different initial conditions; defaults to 0.5. Passed to
#'   \code{\link{fit_gaussians}}
#' @param method the method used to select the initial conditions for
#'   nonlinear least squares optimization (one of "guess" or "random");
#'   see \code{\link{make_initial_conditions}} for details. Passed to

#'   between raw profiles as a feature
#' @param euclidean_distance if true, include the Euclidean distance between
#'   cleaned profiles as a feature
#' @param co_peak if true, include the 'co-peak score' (that is, the distance,
#'   in fractions, between the single highest value of each profile) as a
#'   feature
#' @param co_apex if true, include the 'co-apex score' (that is, the minimum
#'   Euclidean distance between any pair of fit Gaussians) as a feature
#' @param n_pairs if \code{TRUE}, include the number of fractions in which
#'   both of a given pair of proteins were detected as a feature
#' @param classifier the type of classifier to use: one of \code{"NB"} (naive
#'   Bayes), \code{"SVM"} (support vector machine), \code{"RF"} (random forest),
#'   \code{"LR"} (logistic regression), or \code{"ensemble"} (an ensemble of
#'   all four)
#' @param models the number of classifiers to train and average across, each
#'   with a different k-fold cross-validation split
#' @param cv_folds the number of folds to use for k-fold cross-validation
